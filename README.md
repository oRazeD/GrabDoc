# Introduction

GrabDoc is a Blender 4+ add-on for quickly baking trim sheets and tileable texture maps.

After installation, run the one-click scene setup and then start modeling! GrabDoc provides a camera object with the ability to preview your rendered texture maps in real-time via custom shaders in Workbench, EEVEE, and Cycles. Once satisfied you can bake all maps using in-house options or even utilizing Marmoset Toolbag 4's baker for the best results!

# Features

Head to the [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/grabdoc) page for a full feature list!

# Support

GrabDoc is a FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) project, which means I see very little return on my time spent developing and maintaining it.

If you would like to support me, consider buying this add-on on [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/grabdoc), or if you've already done that, send me a tip on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/razed)!
